# YachtClubManagement
The resources are the members of the club, of which the competitors are a separate group, as well as the yachts assigned to them and the instructors. A separate "resource" will be contributions, the payment of which is a condition, for example, for admission to training.
In the future, I would like to expand the app with services provided by the club: equipment rental, parking spaces (wintering and mooring places).
